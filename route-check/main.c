/*
 * An array of graph_node_t instances contains an "adjacent neighbor" list head for
 * each of the nodes in the graph. The "adjacent neighbor" list head contains the
 * "parent" node number (same as the array index) and a pointer to the adjacency
 * entry for the first neighboring node. This, in turn contains the node number for
 * the adjacent node and a pointer to the adjacendy entry for the next neighbor of
 * the parent node. Both the list head and the adjacency entry
 * are specified by a graph_node_t struct.
